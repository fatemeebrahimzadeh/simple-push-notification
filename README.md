# simple-push-notification

This repository provides a service worker implementation that enables web push notifications. It includes a service worker file (sw.js) in the public folder and a file (swDev.ts) in the src folder to handle subscription to push notifications. The applicationServerKey is currently static and is generated with the website instead of being generated dynamically at the backend. Firebase is used for this project since there is no backend. The firebase.js file exports the Firebase instance, which is then imported in app.tsx to call firebase messaging and get the token for cloud messaging service. However, there is an error related to the scope of the service worker, which is addressed by creating a new file (firebase-messaging-sw.js). The repository includes references to tutorials and resources used for this project. It should be noted that this project only works on development mode as it requires personal tokens to be set in Firebase for notifications to be received.
